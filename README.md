# Tengwar-Transcriber
An HTML page that will hopefully be able to transcribe English (and potentially other languages) to Lord of the Rings Elvish Tengwar.

I'm basically trying to make my own version of Tecendil.

I 'stole' [Tecendil](https://tecendil.com)'s version of Tengwar Telcontar, since I didn't want to spend hours figuring out how to make it work without Graphite support, and it's definitely got the most 'features.'
